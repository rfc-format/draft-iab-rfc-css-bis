<t>The HTML format for RFCs assigns style guidance to a Cascading Style Sheet
(CSS) specifically defined for the RFC Series.  The embedded, default CSS as
included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility
needs and to be built along a responsive design model.  This document
describes the requirements for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor. The
class names are based on the classes defined in "HTML for RFCs" (RFC 7992). </t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The HTML format for RFCs, described in <xref target="RFC7992"/>, assigns
style guidance to a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) specifically defined for the
RFC Series.  This CSS will be embedded in the published HTML, and it may be
overridden by a locally defined CSS, as desired.  The embedded, default CSS as
included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility
needs and to be built along a responsive design model.</t> 

<t>This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by the
RFC Editor. Unless called out otherwise, any styling provided for these
classes must not alter the natural language content in any visible way.  Many
of these classes are provided to mark the elements semantically: elements
using them should simply inherit their surrounding styling. Exceptions are
listed below. A class is identified for Internet-Drafts, such that certain
features found only in I-Ds may be made distinct in some fashion within those
drafts.  The requirements will only be applied to HTML documents published by
the RFC Editor as per <xref target="RFC7990"/>.</t> 

<t>The details included in this document are expected to change based on
experience gained in implementing the new publication toolsets. 
Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as the toolsets are
completed. Other implementers must not expect those changes to remain
backwards compatible with the details included in this document.</t>

  classes may include '.art-ascii-art' and '.art-svg'. Artwork will be held

  a variety of screens and devices.</t>

<date month='December' year='2016' />

<abstract><t>The canonical format for the RFC Series has been plain-text, ASCII- encoded for several decades.  After extensive community discussion and debate, the RFC Editor will be transitioning to XML as the canonical format using the XML2RFC version 3 vocabulary.  Different publication formats will be rendered from that base document.  These changes are intended to increase the usability of the RFC Series by offering documents that match the needs of a wider variety of stakeholders.  With these changes, however, comes an increase in complexity for authors, consumers, and the publisher of RFCs.  This document serves as the framework that describes the problems being solved and summarizes the many documents that capture the specific requirements for each aspect of the change in format.</t></abstract>
